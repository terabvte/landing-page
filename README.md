# landing-page
A simple mock-up of a landing page made solely to "test the waters" and improve my beginner level HTML + CSS. Will customize it in the future.
## Process
I tried to create an accurate replica of this page purely as a self-imposed challenge, I'd say there's about 70% fidelity between the [template](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) and the [page](https://terabvte.github.io/landing-page)
## What I learned
- A *lot* of CSS Flexbox
- Various ways to position elements on a page
- Strategies to mimic a template to an actual page as close as possible 
- Some semantic HTML
## What I could improve on
- **Make the page responsive (important)**
- Make the code cleaner, including stuff like:
  * Improving my CSS selection abilities
  * Find more efficient ways to apply CSS styles (I noticed in my code there's a lot of unneeded repetition)
- Make the HTML more meaningful
## What I want to do in the future
- Personalize this page and make it a full-fledged landing page
- Add sick animations
- Add some interactivity (JS!!)
